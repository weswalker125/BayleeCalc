BayleeCalc
==========

A simple Java application which can be used to calculate resting energy expenditure. 
Resting energy expenditure (REE), essentially, is the amount of calories your body burns while at rest; the app calculates the REE based on the equation chosen by the user. 
REE equations currently implemented:
* Harris-Benedict 
* Mifflin-St Jeor
* Ireton-Jones
* Institute of Medicine

There are fields for the patient's weight, height, age and gender.
A BMI field is provided and automatically calculated, purely for convenience.
The REE value is automated calculated and updated as any of the fields are changed.

BayleeCalc (working title) was created for my wife as a means to quickly calculate REE values for a large number of participants.  The equations used are publicly available, any equations which factor in physical activity use a coefficient of 1 in this application, and ventilators are not considered.  Additional equations can be added by request.
